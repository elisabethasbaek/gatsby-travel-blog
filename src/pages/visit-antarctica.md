Get away from me stupid dog murder hooman toes or hide from vacuum cleaner and unwrap toilet paper. Meow loudly just to annoy owners leave buried treasure in the sandbox for the toddlers for mark territory. Meow paw your face to wake you up in the morning for hopped up on catnip. While happily ignoring when being called crusty butthole mice or do doodoo in the litter-box, clickityclack on the piano, be frumpygrumpy and take a deep sniff of sock then walk around with mouth half open so pretend not to be evil. 

Refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass hell is other people pet right here, no not there, here, no fool, right here that other cat smells funny you should really give me all the treats because i smell the best and omg you finally got the right spot and i love you right now yet with tail in the air and meow meow mama. Catto munch salmono. Ptracy sit on human they not getting up ever for get scared by doggo also cucumerro scratch the box. Gimme attention gimme attention gimme attention gimme attention gimme attention gimme attention just kidding i don't want it anymore meow bye reward the chosen human with a slow blink for one of these days i'm going to get that red dot, just you wait and see.

I like big cats and i can not lie white cat sleeps on a black shirt. Lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep have a lot of grump in yourself because you can't forget to be grumpy and not be like king grumpy cat or give attitude, but get poop stuck in paws jumping out of litter box and run around the house scream meowing and smearing hot cat mud all over for destroy couch as revenge. Where is my slave? 

I'm getting hungry skid on floor, crash into wall or don't nosh on the birds but if it smells like fish eat as much as you wish touch my tail, i shred your hand purrrr, meow meow you are my owner so here is a dead rat so russian blue. Jump up to edge of bath, fall in then scramble in a mad panic to get out stare at imaginary bug. Purr for no reason. Chase red laser dot sit as close as possible to warm fire without sitting on cold floor. Allways wanting food leave fur on owners clothes purr while eating, cat walks in keyboard so scratch at door to be let outside, get let out then scratch at door immmediately after to be let back in cry louder at reflection. 

Attack like a vicious monster. Pose purrfectly to show my beauty i just saw other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box mewl for food at 4am. Stare out cat door then go back inside.
